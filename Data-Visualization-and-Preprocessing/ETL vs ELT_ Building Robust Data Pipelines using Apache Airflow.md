##  ETL: Extract → Transform → Load

###  Definition
ETL is a data integration process where data is first **extracted** from source systems, **transformed** into a clean and usable format, and then **loaded** into a target system such as a data warehouse or database.


1. **Extract**  
   - This step involves pulling raw data from various sources: relational databases, APIs, flat files, cloud storage, etc.  
   - Extraction must be reliable and efficient, especially when dealing with large volumes or real-time feeds.

2. **Transform**  
   - Data is cleaned, validated, enriched, and reshaped.  
   - Common transformations include:
     - Removing duplicates
     - Handling missing values
     - Aggregating or joining datasets
     - Applying business logic
   - This step often uses external compute systems like Spark, Python scripts, or ETL tools.

3. **Load**  
   - The transformed data is loaded into a destination system — typically a data warehouse (e.g., Redshift, Snowflake) or a database.  
   - This data is now ready for analytics, reporting, or machine learning.

###  Why ETL?
- Ensures high data quality before storage  
- Ideal for legacy systems or when transformation logic is complex  
- Useful when the destination system has limited compute power

##  ELT: Extract → Load → Transform

###  Definition
ELT is a modern data integration approach where raw data is **extracted** and **loaded** directly into the destination system, and then **transformed** using the system’s native capabilities (e.g., SQL in Snowflake or BigQuery).


1. **Extract**  
   - Same as ETL — data is pulled from various sources.

2. **Load**  
   - Raw data is loaded directly into the data warehouse or lake.  
   - This allows for storage of unprocessed data, which can be useful for auditing or reprocessing.

3. **Transform**  
   - Data is transformed inside the warehouse using SQL or tools like dbt.  
   - This leverages the scalability and performance of modern cloud platforms.

###  Why ELT?
- Faster and more scalable for big data  
- Retains raw data for flexibility  
- Ideal for cloud-native architectures and analytics workflows

##  Apache Airflow: Workflow Orchestration

###  Definition
Apache Airflow is an open-source platform for **authoring, scheduling, and monitoring workflows**. It’s widely used to orchestrate ETL and ELT pipelines across diverse tools and environments.

---

##  Detailed Explanation

Airflow allows you to define workflows as Python code using **Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs)**. Each DAG represents a pipeline, and each node in the DAG is a task.

Airflow doesn’t perform data processing itself — it **orchestrates** tasks that do. Think of it as the conductor of a data orchestra.

---

##  Key Concepts in Apache Airflow

Let’s break down the foundational concepts that make Airflow powerful and flexible:

### 1. **DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph)**  
A DAG is a blueprint of your workflow. It defines the sequence and dependencies of tasks.  
- No cycles allowed — tasks must flow in one direction.  
- DAGs are written in Python and can be dynamic (e.g., generate tasks based on input).

### 2. **Task**  
A task is a single unit of work — like extracting data, running a SQL query, or sending an email.  
- Tasks are defined using **Operators**.  
- Each task has metadata: retries, execution time, dependencies, etc.

### 3. **Operator**  
Operators are templates for tasks. Airflow provides many built-in operators:
- `PythonOperator`: run Python functions  
- `BashOperator`: execute shell commands  
- `PostgresOperator`, `SnowflakeOperator`: run SQL queries  
- `EmailOperator`: send notifications  
You can also create **custom operators** for specific use cases.

### 4. **Sensor**  
Sensors are special tasks that **wait** for a condition to be met before proceeding.  
- Examples: wait for a file to arrive in S3, wait for an API to respond  
- Useful for event-driven workflows

### 5. **XCom (Cross-Communication)**  
XComs allow tasks to **pass data** between each other.  
- For example, a task that extracts a file path can pass it to the next task for processing.  
- XComs are stored in Airflow’s metadata database.

### 6. **Scheduler**  
The scheduler triggers DAGs based on time intervals or external events.  
- You can define schedules using cron expressions or presets like `@daily`, `@hourly`.

### 7. **Executor**  
The executor determines **how tasks are run**:
- `SequentialExecutor`: one task at a time (good for testing)  
- `LocalExecutor`: parallel tasks on one machine  
- `CeleryExecutor`: distributed execution across workers  
- `KubernetesExecutor`: scalable, containerized execution

### 8. **TaskGroup**  
TaskGroups allow you to **organize related tasks** into logical blocks.  
- Improves readability and modularity  
- Useful for grouping steps like “Extract”, “Transform”, “Load”

### 9. **Dynamic Task Mapping**  
Airflow can generate tasks at runtime based on input data.  
- Example: create one task per file in a folder  
- Enables scalable, data-driven workflows

### 10. **Data-Driven Scheduling (Datasets)**  
Airflow can trigger DAGs based on **data updates**, not just time.  
- Example: run a pipeline when a new table is updated  
- Great for real-time or event-based workflows

##  Airflow in ETL vs ELT

| Feature               | ETL Workflow                                  | ELT Workflow                                  |
|------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| Transformation Site   | External (Python, Spark)                      | Internal (SQL in warehouse)                   |
| Airflow Role          | Orchestrates all 3 steps                      | Orchestrates extract + load + SQL transforms  |
| Flexibility           | High (custom logic, external compute)         | High (scalable SQL, dbt integration)          |
| Common Tools          | Python, Pandas, Spark                         | Snowflake, BigQuery, dbt                      |
| Scheduling            | Time-based or event-driven                    | Often triggered by upstream data changes      |

- **ETL** is best when you need to clean and validate data before storing it.
- **ELT** is ideal for cloud-native setups where raw data can be transformed inside the warehouse.
- **Apache Airflow** is the orchestration engine that ties everything together — regardless of whether you choose ETL or ELT.
