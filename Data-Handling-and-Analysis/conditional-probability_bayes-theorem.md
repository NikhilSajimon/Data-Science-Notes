## Conditional Probability

In probability, we often want to know how the occurrence of one event affects the probability of another. This is the core idea behind **conditional probability**.

**Definition:** Conditional probability is the likelihood of an event (A) occurring, **given that** another event (B) has already happened.

We write this as $P(A|B)$ and say "the probability of A given B."

Think of it as updating our knowledge. The universe of all possibilities (the sample space) shrinks to only the outcomes where event B has occurred.

The formula is:
$$P(A|B) = \frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(B)}$$

Where:
-   $P(A \cap B)$ is the probability that **both** A and B happen (the intersection).
-   $P(B)$ is the probability of the event we know has happened. We divide by $P(B)$ because we're narrowing our world to only the outcomes where B is true.

### Intuitive Example: Drawing Cards

Imagine a standard 52-card deck.
-   **Event A:** Drawing a King.
-   **Event B:** Drawing a Face card (King, Queen, or Jack).

**Question:** What is the probability of drawing a King, *given that* we know the card is a Face card? â€” i.e., $P(\text{King} | \text{Face})$.

**1. Without Conditional Probability:** The probability of drawing a King from the full deck is $P(\text{King}) = \frac{4}{52} \approx 7.7\%$.

**2. With Conditional Probability:**
The moment we know the card is a Face card, our sample space is no longer 52 cards. It's now just the 12 Face cards.



Out of these 12 cards, how many are Kings? **4**.

So, the probability is:
$$P(\text{King} | \text{Face}) = \frac{\text{Number of Kings that are also Face cards}}{\text{Total Number of Face cards}} = \frac{4}{12} = \frac{1}{3} \approx 33.3\%$$
Our knowledge that the card was a Face card dramatically increased the probability of it being a King.

**Using the Formula:**
-   $P(\text{King} \cap \text{Face})$: A King is also a Face card, so this is just the probability of drawing a King, which is $\frac{4}{52}$.
-   $P(\text{Face})$: There are 12 Face cards, so the probability is $\frac{12}{52}$.

$$P(\text{King} | \text{Face}) = \frac{P(\text{King} \cap \text{Face})}{P(\text{Face})} = \frac{4/52}{12/52} = \frac{4}{12} = \frac{1}{3}$$
The formula gives us the same, correct result.

## The Master Key: Bayes' Theorem

Bayes' Theorem is one of the most important concepts in probability and data science. It's a simple but incredibly powerful formula that lets us **update our beliefs in the light of new evidence**.

It allows us to "flip" a conditional probability. Often, we might know $P(B|A)$ but we really want to find $P(A|B)$. Bayes' theorem is the bridge.

The formula is:
$$P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)}$$

Let's break down the components:

-   **Posterior Probability ($P(A|B)$):** What we want to find. The probability of our hypothesis (A) being true, given the evidence (B) we've seen. This is our *updated* belief.

-   **Likelihood ($P(B|A)$):** The probability of seeing the evidence (B) if our hypothesis (A) is true.

-   **Prior Probability ($P(A)$):** Our initial belief in the hypothesis (A) *before* seeing any evidence.

-   **Evidence ($P(B)$):** The overall probability of observing the evidence, regardless of the hypothesis.

Bayes' Theorem essentially says:
**Posterior = (Likelihood Ã— Prior) / Evidence**

### A Classic Example: Medical Diagnosis

This is the best way to understand the power of Bayes' Theorem.

**Scenario:**
-   A rare disease affects 1 in 10,000 people.
-   There's a test for this disease that is 99% accurate. This means:
    -   If a person **has** the disease, the test will be positive 99% of the time (this is called **sensitivity**).
    -   If a person **does not have** the disease, the test will be negative 99% of the time. This means it has a 1% false positive rate (this is 1 - **specificity**).

**Question:** You take the test and it comes back **positive**. What is the actual probability that you have the disease?

Let's define our events:
-   **A:** You have the disease.
-   **B:** You test positive.

We want to find $P(A|B)$, the probability of having the disease given a positive test.

**Step 1: Identify the "Givens" from the problem statement.**
-   **Prior ($P(A)$):** The probability of having the disease is 1 in 10,000.
    $P(A) = \frac{1}{10000} = 0.0001$
    This also means the probability of not having the disease is $P(\neg A) = 1 - 0.0001 = 0.9999$.

-   **Likelihood ($P(B|A)$):** The probability of testing positive if you have the disease (the test's sensitivity).
    $P(B|A) = 0.99$

-   We also know the false positive rate: the probability of testing positive even if you **don't** have the disease.
    $P(B|\neg A) = 1\% = 0.01$

**Step 2: Calculate the Probability of the Evidence ($P(B)$).**
How can a person test positive? There are two ways:
1.  They have the disease **and** test positive (a true positive).
2.  They don't have the disease **and** test positive (a false positive).

We use the **Law of Total Probability**:
$$P(B) = P(B|A)P(A) + P(B|\neg A)P(\neg A)$$$$P(B) = (0.99 \cdot 0.0001) + (0.01 \cdot 0.9999)$$$$P(B) = 0.000099 + 0.009999 \approx 0.010098$$
The overall chance of anyone testing positive is about 1%.

**Step 3: Apply Bayes' Theorem.**
Now we have all the pieces to calculate our posterior probability, $P(A|B)$.
$$P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)}$$
$$P(A|B) = \frac{0.99 \cdot 0.0001}{0.010098} \approx 0.0098$$

**Result:**
The probability that you actually have the disease, even with a positive test, is only about **0.98%** (less than 1%)! ðŸ¤¯

**Why?** Because the disease is so rare (a low prior probability), the vast majority of positive tests will be false positives from the huge pool of healthy people. Your prior belief was so low that even strong evidence (a 99% accurate test) couldn't raise it very much.

### Why Bayes' Theorem is Crucial for Data Science

-   **Spam Filters:** This is a classic application. A filter calculates $P(\text{Spam} | \text{Words like "Viagra", "money"})$ by looking at the likelihood of those words appearing in known spam and non-spam emails.
-   **A/B Testing:** It's used to update the probability that version B of a webpage is better than version A as more user data comes in.
-   **Machine Learning Models:** The Naive Bayes classifier is a simple but effective algorithm for classification tasks, built directly on Bayes' theorem.
-   **Bayesian Inference:** It provides a framework for reasoning about uncertainty and updating our models as we collect more data, which is the very essence of learning from data.
